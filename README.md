# Welcome to one of my firsts IoT projects!

Wish me luck!

## To make things clearer

This repo proporse is to only document a inital mqtt protocol setup to work with IoT.

The target of this project is to build a working fingerprint authentication process with software and hardware.

We gonna be using the esp32 nodemcu, with wifi connection, and DY50 from adafruit, an local hiveMQ broker and a java mqtt client server.
